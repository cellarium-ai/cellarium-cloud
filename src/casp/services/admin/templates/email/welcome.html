    <h2>Access details (unique to you)</h2>
    <p>To access the service, you’ll need the following API token:</p>
    <div style="background:#F3F5F6;padding:10px;margin:10px 0;width:700px;font-family:monospace">
        {key}
    </div>
    <p>This API token is issued specifically to you. Please keep your token secure and do not share it with others 🤫.</p>

    <h2>Access caveats</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Each account is initially credited with a quota of <strong>50,000 annotated cells</strong> (across all API calls).</li>
        <li>Providing feedback on the service will increase your quota to <strong>200,000 annotated cells</strong>.</li>
        <li>A link to submit feedback will be automatically generated by the client library after each successful annotation API call. Your feedback is invaluable to us, and we appreciate your time and effort in helping us improve the service.</li>
        <li>During the public beta phase, each API token is limited to processing a <strong>weekly quota of 100,000 annotated cells</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
