Welcome to the Cellarium Cell Annotation Service (CAS)!

We are thrilled that you are interested in using Cellarium CAS and we hope that this service will help you accelerate your cell biology research and discovery! ðŸš€

To access the service, you will need the following API token:

{key}

This API token is issued specifically to you. Please keep your token secure and do not share it with others. ðŸ¤«

To quickly get started with Cellarium CAS, please follow the tutorial available at: https://github.com/cellarium-ai/cellarium-cas/blob/main/notebooks/quickstart_tutorial.ipynb.

For comprehensive guidance and detailed information, visit the official Cellarium CAS documentation at: https://cellarium-cas.readthedocs.io.

We are currently in the beta testing phase of the service, and each API token is limited to processing a weekly quota of 100,000 annotated cells (across all API calls). Additional quota can be earned by providing feedback on the service. A link to submit feedback will be automatically generated by the client library after each successful annotation API call. Your feedback is invaluable to us, and we appreciate your time and effort in helping us improve the service.

If you did not request this API token ðŸ¤·, need additional quota ðŸ’¸, or have any other questions ðŸ™‹, please contact the CAS support team at: cas-support@cellarium.ai. We are here to support you, so please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, feedback, or issues you may encounter.
