  <p><b>Welcome to the Cellarium Cell Annotation Service (CAS)!</b></p>
  <p>We are thrilled that you are interested in using Cellarium CAS and we hope that this service will help you accelerate your cell biology research and discovery! ðŸš€</p>
  <br>
  <p>To access the service, you will need the following API token:</p>
  <div style="background:#F3F5F6;padding:10px;margin:10px 0;width:700px;font-family:monospace">
      {key}
  </div>
  <p>This API token is issued specifically to you. <b>Please keep your token secure and do not share it with others.</b> ðŸ¤«</p>
  <br>
  <p>
    To quickly get started with Cellarium CAS, please follow the tutorial available at:
    <a href="https://github.com/cellarium-ai/cellarium-cas/blob/main/notebooks/quickstart_tutorial.ipynb">https://github.com/cellarium-ai/cellarium-cas/blob/main/notebooks/quickstart_tutorial.ipynb</a>.

  </p>
  <p>
    We are currently in the beta testing phase of the service, and each API token is limited to processing a weekly quota of 100,000 annotated cells (across all API calls). Additional quota can be earned by providing feedback on the service. A link to submit feedback will be automatically generated by the client library after each successful annotation API call. <b>Your feedback is invaluable to us, and we appreciate your time and effort in helping us improve the service.</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you did not request this API token ðŸ¤·, need additional quota ðŸ’¸, or have any other questions ðŸ™‹, please contact the CAS support team at:
    <a href="mailto:cas-support@cellarium.ai">cas-support@cellarium.ai</a>. We are here to support you, so please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, feedback, or issues you may encounter.
