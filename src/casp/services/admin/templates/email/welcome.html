  <p><b>Welcome to the Cellarium Cell Annotation Service (CAS) Public Beta Program!</b></p>
  <p>We are thrilled that you are interested in using Cellarium CAS and we hope that this service will help you accelerate your cell biology research and discovery! 🚀</p>
  <br>
  <p>To access the service, you will need the following API token:</p>
  <div style="background:#F3F5F6;padding:10px;margin:10px 0;width:700px;font-family:monospace">
      {key}
  </div>
  <p>This API token is issued specifically to you. <b>Please keep your token secure and do not share it with others.</b> 🤫</p>
  <br>
  <p>
    The easiest way to get started with CAS is through running the <b>Quickstart Tutorial</b> on Google Colab by clicking on the following link:
    <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1m9zgqP5n7E4pGGCg5RjfvlCnS6uqUdSa">https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1m9zgqP5n7E4pGGCg5RjfvlCnS6uqUdSa</a>. Just remember to paste your API token in the appropriate place. <b>Going through the tutorial is really fun and takes less than 5 minutes. We know you are busy 🐝, and we have tried to make it as quick and easy as possible for you to get started.</b>

  <p>
    We are currently in the public beta testing phase of the service, and each API token is limited to processing a weekly quota of 100,000 annotated cells (across all API calls). Each account is additionally limited to a lifetime quota of 200,000 free annotated cells. Additional quota can be earned by providing feedback on the service. A link to submit feedback will be automatically generated by the client library after each successful annotation API call. <b>Your feedback is invaluable to us, and we appreciate your time and effort in helping us improve the service.</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you did not request this API token 🤷, need additional quota 💸, or have any other questions 🙋, please contact the CAS support team at:
    <a href="mailto:cas-support@cellarium.ai">cas-support@cellarium.ai</a>. We are here to support you, so please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, feedback, or issues you may encounter.
