Welcome to the Cellarium Cell Annotation Service (CAS)!

We are thrilled that you are interested in using Cellarium CAS and we hope that this service will help you accelerate your cell biology research and discovery! 🚀

To access the service, you will need the following API token:

{key}

This API token is issued specifically to you. Please keep your token secure and do not share it with others. 🤫

The easiest way to get started with CAS is through running the Quickstart Tutorial on Google Colab by clicking on the following link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1m9zgqP5n7E4pGGCg5RjfvlCnS6uqUdSa. Just remember to paste your API token in the appropriate place. Going through the tutorial is really fun and takes less than 5 minutes. We know you are busy 🐝, and we have tried to make it as quick and easy as possible for you to get started.

For comprehensive guidance and detailed information, visit the official Cellarium CAS documentation at: https://cellarium-cas.readthedocs.io.

We are currently in the public beta testing phase of the service, and each API token is limited to processing a weekly quota of 100,000 annotated cells (across all API calls). Each account is additionally limited to a lifetime quota of 200,000 free annotated cells. Additional quota can be earned by providing feedback on the service. A link to submit feedback will be automatically generated by the client library after each successful annotation API call. Your feedback is invaluable to us, and we appreciate your time and effort in helping us improve the service.

If you did not request this API token 🤷, need additional quota 💸, or have any other questions 🙋, please contact the CAS support team at: cas-support@cellarium.ai. We are here to support you, so please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, feedback, or issues you may encounter.
