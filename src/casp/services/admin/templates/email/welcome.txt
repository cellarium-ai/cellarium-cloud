We are thrilled you’re interested in using Cellarium CAS to help accelerate your cell biology research and discovery! 🚀

How to get started
==================

To get started with CAS, we suggest running the Quickstart Tutorial on Google Colab. Going through the tutorial is really fun and takes less than 5 minutes. We know you are busy 🐝, and we’ve tried to make it as quick and easy as possible for you to get started!

    2. Remember to paste your API token (shown below) in the appropriate place.

Access details (unique to you)
==============================

To access the service, you’ll need the following API token:
{key}

This API token is issued specifically to you. Please keep your token secure and do not share it with others 🤫.

Access caveats
==============

    * Each account is initially credited with a quota of 50,000 annotated cells (across all API calls).
    * Providing feedback on the service will increase your quota to 200,000 annotated cells.
    * A link to submit feedback will be automatically generated by the client library after each successful annotation API call. Your feedback is invaluable to us, and we appreciate your time and effort in helping us improve the service.
    * During the public beta phase, each API token is limited to processing a weekly quota of 100,000 annotated cells.
