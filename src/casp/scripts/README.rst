Scripts
-------

This package includes scripts needed to maintain the services and data in the CAS backend application.
These scripts are used to build resource files (e.g., a resource file for cell type ontology used by the
Consensus Engine), generate data extracts, run benchmarks, and more. They are not exposed for execution by CAS users.


Below is the list of different scripts:
